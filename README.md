##Introduction
The BrightLearn Sales Case Study provides a simulated dataset representing daily sales information for a single product in a large retail store.
The dataset includes key metrics such as the date of sale, total sales value, cost of sales, and quantity sold.
The objective of this analysis is to derive insights from the dataset by calculating metrics like daily sales price per unit,
average unit price, daily gross profit percentages, and price elasticity of demand during promotional periods. Additionally,
the analysis aims to uncover further trends and patterns through visualizations, reports, 
and key performance indicators (KPIs) that can guide decision-making for improving sales performance.
