## Introduction

The BrightLearn Sales Case Study provides daily sales data for a single product, including sales value,
cost of sales, and quantity sold. The analysis aims to calculate key metrics like unit price, gross profit,
and price elasticity, while uncovering insights through visuals and KPIs to support better sales decisions

## project overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the daily sales performance of a single product in a large retail store using the provided dataset.
The analysis involves calculating key metrics such as daily sales price per unit, average unit price, 
daily gross profit percentages, and price elasticity of demand during promotional periods. Additionally,
the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and insights through visualizations, reports, and KPIs to support strategic decisions for improving sales
and profitability. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for the store’s management based on data-driven finding

## Objectives
